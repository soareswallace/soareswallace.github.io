			Since the begining of the internet we had login forms, accounts and sign ups all around it. Companies that provide a service as cloud storage and file sharing rely on these types login forms to authenticate users into their accounts. One of the most typical attacks against these mechanisms is the brute force attack. Basically an attacker has a list with lots and lots of passwords found on the internet<a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-20.txt">(e.g.:The rockyou password list)</a> from leaks basically happening every moment. It has been more often recenlty, to be honest.
